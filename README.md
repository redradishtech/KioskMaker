Need a custom 'kiosk' operating system that:

 - runs a Chrome browser full screen
 - ..with a hardcoded URL
 - ..no other UI
 - ..and a read-only hard disk
 - ..but that is configurable at deploy time?


That's us! See the [![docs](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-available-blue)](https://redradishtech.github.io/KioskMaker)
